          <h3>Estimates</h3>
          <p>When you visit one of Legacy Autobody Group's shop, you will receive an estimate by one of our PA licensed appraisers using the industry's latest software. We examine your vehicle for damage and will determine what needs to be repaired or replaced. We also make sure it's safe to continue operating before the repair.</p>

          <p>You will be given a scheduled repair appointment and we handle the rest. We coordinate the repairs on your behalf with the insurance company in order to provide a stress-free experience.</p>

          <h3>Collision Repair</h3>
          <p>For quality concious consumers, Legacy Autobody Group has the best autobody repair shops in the area that provide both peace of mind and the highest quality collision repair service.</p>
          <h4>Body</h4>
          <p>Repairing damage is not about putting on some "Bondo" then painting. Today's modern cars are made from many different materials. These materials range from flexible thermoplastics to ultra-high strength steel. Our highly-skilled technicians ensure your car is expertly repaired.</p>
          <h4>Frame / Unibody</h4>
          <p>Today's modern cars are constructed with very tight tolerances, as little as 1 mm (the thickness of a dime). Our state-of-the-art Chief frame rack and Car-o-liner computerized, electronic unibody measuring systems, enable us to accurately and safely align your vehicle's frame to manufacturer specifications.</p>
          <h4>Paint</h4>
          <p>Certified Legacy Autobody Group painters are expertly trained to use our hi-tech, industry-leading, paint-mixing system. Using only the finest paint from Sikkens, our technicians use state-of-the-art Accudraft paint booths. These booths, in comparison to booths used in traditional car painting, create more durable finishes with unsurpassed beauty and faster finishing times.</p>

          <h3>Direct Insurance Claims Processing</h3>
          <p>All of our shops are Direct Repair Facilities for many different insurance companies and can assist you with processing your claim. DRP's (Direct Repair Programs) are an optional program of the insurance carrier. These DRP's are basically direct billing programs and agreements between shops and insurance companies to assist their customers in collision repair and initial claims processing.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that all insurance companies, just like repair facilities, are not the same. That's why Legacy Autobody Group has chosen to participate with ONLY A SELECT GROUP of insurance DRP programs.</p>
          <p>If we have decided not to participate with the DRP program of your particular insurance company, that will not affect the repair of your vehicle. Our goal is to satisfy YOU with the repairs on your vehicle, while respecting the guidelines set by your insurance policy.</p>

          <h3>Paintless Dent Repair</h3>
          <p>The Paintless Repair (PDR) approach removes dents and dings from vehicles without affecting the original factory finish. Our skilled technicians use specially designed tools to form body metal to its original condition. Our PDR process is faster and less expensive than traditional body shop methods of repair.</p>
          <p>Paintless Dent Repair is a craft. It replaces the need to spend several days on the repair. PDR has rapidly become the desired method of repair for these types of damages. Repairs can be performed more timely, for less money and at your convenience.</p>
