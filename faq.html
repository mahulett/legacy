      <p class="faq-question" id="faq1">What do I do after an accident?</p>
      <p>First, make sure everyone is alright. Next, if possible, move all vehicles to the side of the road. If assistance is needed, call 911. Then, be sure to get personal and insurance information from any parties involved. After all people and vehicles have left the scene, report the claim to your insurance agent and inform them that you want your vehicle repaired at a Legacy Autobody Group shop if it has not already been towed there.</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq2">I have AAA, should I call them to tow my vehicle if I am in an accident?</p>
      <p>You can, but your vehicle will be towed to the local AAA towing facility unless you specify to have it towed to a Legacy Autobody Group shop. Your insurance company (or the insurance company of the person who hit you) will pay Legacy Autobody Group directly to tow your vehicle. So your best option would be to call one of our shops to tow your vehicle to ensure that it ends up at one of our facilities and to avoid any unnecessary charges to your insurance company from another towing company.</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq3">Do I need to make an appointment for an estimate?</p>
      <p>Absolutely not. Our office is open from 8am to 6pm Monday-Friday. Someone will be able to assist you with an estimate during these hours. Of course it doesn’t hurt to call first in the unlikely event that the entire appraisal staff is away.</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq4">Do I need more than one estimate?</p>
      <p>No. PA state law does not require you to get more than one estimate.</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq5">I reported my claim to my insurance company. They gave me a list of repair facilities that they deal with, and you are not one of them. Can you still repair my car?</p>
      <p>Yes. We have direct repair relationships with many major insurers. It is almost impossible to have direct repair relationships with all of them. We do however deal with all insurance companies whether we are on there program or not. We handle all the negotiations with them so you don’t have to. It is important to remember, that the law states that it is your choice to get your vehicle repaired at the repair facility of your choice.</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq6">What are aftermarket parts and do you use them?</p>
      <p>Aftermarket parts are parts that are not made by the original vehicle manufacturer. Most of the parts come from Asia and may not fit as well or last as long as the OEM pieces. We do use them, but only if you approve of the use and your insurance company recommends them. Depending on your insurance policy, you may not have a choice as to whether to use them or not. In these instances, you may have to pay additional for OEM parts if you want them and your insurance company will not pay the difference. If you do not want aftermarket parts on your vehicle, it is important to mention this to your insurance agent. They may be able to write a policy that excludes the use of aftermarket parts. It may cost a few dollars more per year, but it will cost less than paying for the difference in OEM parts if you are involved in an accident.</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq7">How long will an insurance company pay for a rental car?</p>
      <p>It depends on the insurance policy. You may not even have coverage at all. If you do have coverage, it can vary greatly. Anywhere from $15-$25 per day, a $500 max, a 30 day max, or partial pay by you and your insurance company, are some examples. If you are in need of a rental, we have vehicles on site from Kulp Rental Cars. A simple call to them will have a vehicle at our facility ready to go. This way, you only have to come to one place to complete your entire repair process.</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq8">I do not have rental coverage or another car to drive, what are my options?</p>
      <p>Legacy Autobody Group has free loaner cars that we keep for situations like this. However, they are almost always on the road and it may be difficult for us to have one available when you need it. It would be best to call in advance so we can try to have one available for you. Another option would be to use our pick-up and delivery service. We can pick up your vehicle when we are ready to begin repairs and deliver it to you when repairs are complete.</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq9">Do I have a deductible, and if so, who do I pay it to?</p>
      <p>It depends on your insurance policy. If you are going through another party’s insurance, you have no deductible. Deductibles can range anywhere from $50 to $1000 per claim. It is important to check with your insurance agent to see if you have a deductible and how much it is. If you do owe a deductible, it is payable to the shop upon picking up your vehicle. We accept cash, check, debit cards, and credit cards (VISA, Master Card, Discover, and American Express).</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq10">I think my frame is damaged, is my car totaled?</p>
      <p>Not necessarily. A vehicle is totaled based on the amount, in dollars, to repair the vehicle versus the amount the vehicle is worth. The percentage can vary, but is usually in the 70%-90% range of what your vehicle is worth. Frame and unibody damage, even severe can be repaired safely. With today’s modern equipment and the availability of virtually every part on your vehicle, damaged areas can be repaired or replaced without any adverse affects to your vehicle. It is not uncommon for us to replace, for example, an entire frame on a truck with a new frame from the factory. If your vehicle needs this type of repair, it is important that it is done by a facility such as ours that has the equipment and mechanical expertise to remove and reinstall engines, transmissions, and suspension components. Our extensive training allows us to perform these types of repairs in the safest manner possible.</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq11">Can I wash my car after it is painted?</p>
      <p>Yes, but it doesn’t hurt to wait a week and to do it by hand for the first 30 days instead of a commercial car wash. If you need to wax your vehicle, our paint company, and most others, recommends that you wait at least 30 days before doing so.</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq12">I'm totally overwhelmed, I got in my first accident and have no clue what to do. Can I just drop my vehicle off and not worry about anything?</p>
      <p>Of course. We have done this thousands of times since 1971. You can simply bring in your vehicle, give us your insurance information, get in an on-site rental car, and leave the paperwork, repairs, and hassles up to us. You can be as involved or uninvolved in the repair process as you want to be. This is what we do. It really can be as simple as; Drop off, relax, pick up!</p>
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq13">How can I trust you to repair my vehicle safely and to my expectations?</p>
      <p>Besides the extensive training our technicians go through and our continuous investments in the latest and best equipment, we offer a warranty. It is a lifetime warranty and basically states that if you are unhappy with just about any repairs we made to your vehicle for as long as you own it, we will do whatever it takes to make you happy.</p>
