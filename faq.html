      <p class="faq-question" id="faq1">What do I do after an accident?</p>
      <p>First, make sure everyone is alright. Next, if possible, move all vehicles to the side of the road. If assistance is needed, call 911. Then, be sure to get personal and insurance information from any parties involved. After all people and vehicles have left the scene, contacted your nearest Legacy Autobody Group location and we will assist in reporting the claim to your insurance agent.</p>
      <hr class="faq-break">
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq2">I'm totally overwhelmed, I got in my first accident and have no clue what to do. Can I just drop my vehicle off and not worry about anything?</p>
      <p>Of course. We have done this thousands of times since 1971. You can simply bring in your vehicle, give us your insurance information, get in an on-site rental car, and leave the paperwork, repairs, and hassles up to us. You can be as involved or uninvolved in the repair process as you want to be. This is what we do. It really can be as simple as; Drop off, relax, pick up!</p>
      <hr class="faq-break">
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq3">How can I trust you to repair my vehicle safely and to my expectations?</p>
      <p>Besides the extensive training our technicians go through and our continuous investments in the latest and best equipment, we offer a warranty. It is a lifetime warranty and basically states that if you are unhappy with just about any repairs we made to your vehicle for as long as you own it, we will do whatever it takes to make you happy.</p>
      <hr class="faq-break">
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq4">I have AAA, should I call them to tow my vehicle if I am in an accident?</p>
      <p>You can, but your vehicle will be towed to the local AAA towing facility unless you specify to have it towed to a Legacy Autobody Group shop. Your insurance company (or the insurance company of the person who hit you) will pay Legacy Autobody Group directly to tow your vehicle. So your best option would be to call one of our shops to tow your vehicle to ensure that it ends up at one of our facilities and to avoid any unnecessary charges to your insurance company from another towing company.</p>
      <hr class="faq-break">
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq5">Do I need to make an appointment for an estimate?</p>
      <p>You don’t need an appointment. However, to better save you time, please contact us for an appointment so we can ensure an appraiser is available to complete your estimate. Our offices are open from 7:30am to 5 pm Monday-Friday. Someone will be able to assist you with an estimate during these hours. </p>
      <hr class="faq-break">
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq6">Do I need more than one estimate?</p>
      <p>No. PA state law does not require you to get more than one estimate.</p>
      <hr class="faq-break">
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq7">I reported my claim to my insurance company. They gave me a list of repair facilities that they deal with, and you are not one of them. Can you still repair my car?</p>
      <p>Yes. We have direct repair relationships with many major insurers. It is important to remember, that the law states that it is your choice to get your vehicle repaired at the repair facility of your choice. It is almost impossible to have direct repair relationships with all of them. We do work with all insurance companies whether through a direct repair program or not. We handle all the negotiations with the insurance company so you don’t have to.</p>
      <hr class="faq-break">
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq8">How long will an insurance company pay for a rental car?</p>
      <p>It depends on the insurance policy. Our knowledgeable staff will help determine your rental car coverage. If you are in need of a rental, we have vehicles on site and can arrange for a rental during your repair.</p>
      <hr class="faq-break">
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq9">I do not have rental coverage or another car to drive, what are my options?</p>
      <p>We do not offer free loaner vehicles. Legacy Autobody Group can assist in getting a discounted rental car rate if you need a replacement vehicle while we fix your car. We also offer a free courtesy shuttle. Please let us know if you need assistance and we will be happy to help.</p>
      <hr class="faq-break">
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq10">Do I have a deductible, and if so, who do I pay it to?</p>
      <p>It depends on your insurance policy. If you are going through another party’s insurance, you have no deductible. It is important to check with your insurance agent to see if you have a deductible and how much it is. If you do owe a deductible, it is payable to the shop upon picking up your vehicle. We accept cash, check, debit cards, and credit cards (VISA, Master Card, Discover, and American Express).</p>
      <hr class="faq-break">
      <p class="faq-question" id="faq11">Can I wash my car after it is painted?</p>
      <p>Yes, but it doesn’t hurt to wait a week and to do it by hand for the first 30 days instead of a commercial car wash. If you need to wax your vehicle, our paint company, and most others, recommends that you wait at least 30 days before doing so.</p>
